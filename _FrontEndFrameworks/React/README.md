# Intro to React

# Object Oriented Programming

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **students have covered the full-stack**. Frameworks are the last unit to be coered before the final projects. React and Angular can be covered in any order, but I would recommend covering Angular first, as it is a full MVC framwork - it helps put React's place in a web apps stack into perspective better.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 2 to 4 full days to introduce and up to a week to work on a full stack React application.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce MVC
  1. Talk about why we use MVC and why seperation of concerns is important when building an application.
1. Introduce Single Page Applications [SPAs]
  1. Discuss what a SPA is, and the types of applications that are SPAs [gmail, Facebook, maps, etc.]
1. Introduce React (whiteboard, lecture and live coding demo)
    1. Start with the fundamentals of React and how to [think in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).
        - *Recommend: Whiteboard an example of a building a sample React app and it's respective components*
1. Present **Intro to React** Slideshow: [React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
1. Live Code **Simple React Project** Live Code Demo: [React Demo](https://github.com/devleague/react_redux_demo/tree/master/1-Simple_Setup)
1. Assign **React Kanban**: [React Kanban](https://github.com/devleague/React-Kanban)
1. Live Code **Refactor App and Intro to Webpack** Live Code Demo: [Refactor app and integrate Webpack](https://github.com/devleague/react_redux_demo/tree/master/2-Webpack_Refactor)
1. Live Code **React Router** Live Code Demo: [React Router](https://github.com/devleague/react_redux_demo/tree/master/3-Router)

1. [Optional] Live Code **Async Redux and Redux Middleware** Live Code Demo: [Async_Redux and Redux Middleware](https://github.com/devleague/react_redux_demo/tree/master/5-Async_Redux_Middleware)
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **Components**, **State**, and **Redux** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.
