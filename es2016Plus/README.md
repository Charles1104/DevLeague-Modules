# ES2016 PLus

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after the students feel very comfortable with ES5 JavaScript syntax. This will suppliment their knowledge of ES6 and build on top of a firm understanding of JavaScript. They should be able to appreciate the pain points that ES6 is attempting to solve.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce and up to a day's worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding

- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce ES6 [talk]
  1. Talk about the history of JS and why we use
1. Present **ES6 Plus** Slideshow: [ES6 Plus Slides](http://slides.com/joecarlson/es6)
1. Assign **ES6 Portfolio Piece Refactor**
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **ES6**, **Major ES^ concepts** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.

# Slides & Examples

#### ES6 Plus
- Link: [ES6 Plus Slides](http://slides.com/joecarlson/es6)
- Time Needed to Present: < 45 minutes
- Type: **Slideshow**

# Exercises & Projects
The following exercises and projects state an average time alotted. A session is about 3 hours. There are 3 sessions in a day: (1) After the morning challenge up to lunch, (2) after lunch up to dinner, (3) after dinner until the end of class.

#### ES6 Portfolio Piece Refactor
- Repository: Any portfolio project [Express Galley, Kanban, etc...]
- Average Time Alotted: 3 sessions
- Individual or Group: Individual Exercise
- Completed Example: N/A
- Concepts Practiced: *ES6 Constructors*, *ES6 Instance Properties*, *Scope Variables*, *ES6 Super Call*, *Maps*, *Sets* and *Exporting and Importing Modules*
- Notes: Add Airbnb ESlint to an old project and refactor it to be ES6 complient - great practice using ES6 for a real project - plus it has the posibility of making the code look super dope.
