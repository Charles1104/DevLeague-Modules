> This module was prepared by Laura Gonzalez.

I submitted my application with 2 essays and my resume in markdown to MS a few days before the deadline.

A few weeks later I found an invitation to sign up for interviews...in my spam folder!
Anyway, I followed the directions in the email and attempted to sign up for 2 potential time slots, but there were none available. I contacted the contractor in charge of scheduling and they opened up more slots.

A few days later the head of the Leap program added the interviews to my calendar with a promise of details to come.

The day before the interviews I got an email with my interviewers names and a link to collabedit.com: a web text editor that I would have the option to use during my interview and could invite the interviewer to. The email also gave a link to join the Skype call. I looked up my interviewers on LinkedIn to see if I could gather any information on them :). Both of my interviewers work in the Xbox One division, one is a data scientist and backend/database developer, the other is a back-end compatibility dev lead.

The day of the interview I decided to test out that link to join the call, just to be SURE it worked properly (you know how these things go) and it didn't do anything. (!!!) So I followed some help links and ended up downloading their Skype desktop app, which then allowed me into the call. I am SO glad I checked ahead of time.

### INTERVIEW #1 with Mark

Mark's video didn't work so I only saw his cartoon avatar the whole time. He arrived early and reviewed my resume while I asked him questions about working at MS and how he got started and such. He asked me to talk a little about myself and had me expand more about my non-dev experience to get to know me better. He asked me what the differences are between relational and non relational databases and to describe how to force constraints on a Mongo database. He asked "for fun" if I would be able to build a database in Mongo that would be able to scale up infinitely.

Now the real questions:

INT HEXTOINT(STRING) --- He wrote this in the chat window and asked me to write this program, didn't give any details. I asked for more clarification, he said to write a program that takes in a hexadecimal value and returns an int.

9 MARBLES --- You have 9 marbles and a justice scale; all marbles are identical except one which weighs a little bit less. You can only determine the one that weighs less by comparing them on the justice scale. What is the fewest possible comparisons you can make to reveal --with certainty-- which one weighs the least?

TRIANGLE --- I'm not sure I remember this one correctly, but from what I remember: There is a triangle with 2 sides of equal length, they are each 1 mile long. You drive up the triangle going 30MPH. Without taking acceleration or resistance into account, how fast would you need to travel the length of the other side to average 60MPH for the 2 miles?

3 SWITCHES --- There are two rooms connected by a one-way door, you are in one room and cannot see into the other room. There are 3 switches in your room that are connected to 3 light bulbs in the other room. How can you determine which switch correlates to which light bulb by only checking the other room a single time?

SQUARE PAPER --- Write instructions for someone who knows nothing to draw a square on a piece of 8 x 11 paper.

LOST --- You wake up in a field with nothing but the clothes you are wearing and only remember having dinner with your friends, what do you do? This one was open ended and was just to get an idea of my thought process.

### INTERVIEW #2 with Brian

Brian said hello and then gave me the problem to solve right away, he wrote it in the chat and explained a little as he went.

          o            o
    <-------------------->
          x             x

You have an 1D universe (the line) that continues infinitely in both directions.
There are 2 robots at any point in the universe; marked by "o" (dont worry about the impossible mechanics of it, he says).

There are 2 markers that represent where the robots start, the markers never move; marked by "x".
Write a program that will be executed by both robots at the same time that will cause them to collide using only the following language:

1. ML - move 1 step left, takes 1 unit of time
1. MR - move 1 step right, takes 1 unit of time

IF - an if statement that checks whether the robot is at a marker, if true, the robot will skip the next command and continue from the one after, if false, it will continue to the next command, takes 1 unit of time

GT - a "go-to" which will send the robot to a specific command in the code which you will tag, takes 1 unit of time (for example: GT <an arbitrary name> will make the robot go to the command with the tag "an arbitrary name").

Overall it was a pretty good experience!
Let me know if you have any questions. :D
