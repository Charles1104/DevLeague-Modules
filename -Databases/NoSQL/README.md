# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructions can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce NoSQL vs Relational Databases(white board)
1. Present **NoSQL** Slide Deck: [https://github.com/devleague/slides-nosql](https://github.com/devleague/slides-nosql)
1. Assign **MongoDB practice**: [https://gist.github.com/theRemix/7305403e1ab6fc8674f0](https://gist.github.com/theRemix/7305403e1ab6fc8674f0)
1. Check in on students - assign small groups and whiteboard differences between NoSQL and Relational databases to one another
1. Refactor **PixelPainter** assignment by adding NoSQL database using Mongoose
1. Verify
