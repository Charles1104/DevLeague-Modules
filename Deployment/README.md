# Deployment

## Prerequisites
This material should come after creating a fully featured deployable web application. Students should already be familiar with basic linux commands.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce and up to a day's worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

---

- Students should *be able to explain*
  - what a server(differences between a shared host, VPS, and etc.) is.
  - how an http request works (from browser to server and back).
- Students should *know about*
  - how to traverse and work in a VPS (or server) environment.
  - deploy and run project environments on a staging or production server.
