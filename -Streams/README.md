# Streams

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **Events** and before **HTTP**. Students should already be familiar with basic **Node.js**

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce and up to 3-4 days worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

---

#### Node.js Streams
- Students should fully **grok** streams
    - Students should be able to **explain** readable stream interfaces
    - Students should be able to **explain** writeable stream interfaces
    - Students should **know about** creating readable listeners in Node.js
    - Students should **know about** piping data (writing data)
    - Students should **know about** duplex streams(readable and writeable)


#### Basic HTTP
- Students should **know about** HTTP (reserve for HTTP module ahead)
- Students should **know about** TCP default port

#### Web Sockets
- Students should **fully grok** web sockets
