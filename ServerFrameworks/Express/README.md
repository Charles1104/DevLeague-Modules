# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce ExpressJS (Whiteboard and talk)
1. Present **ExpressJS Part Deux** Slideshow: [ExpressJS Part Deux](http://slides.com/joecarlson/express-yourself-deux#/)
1. Assign *Pixel Painter ExpressJS Refactor* - Build an Express server for Pixel-Painter. Based on what was presented in the lecture the students will create a server for one of their previous assignments. Focus on Project alteration, static-file serving, has only one route.
