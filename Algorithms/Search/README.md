## Topics
- a list of topics for this module
- define a level of understanding for each topic
- example:
    - Defining Classes [grok]
    - Instantiating Objects [grok]
    - Class Inheritence [grok]
    - Interfaces [teach]
    - Polymorphism [about]
    - Multiple Inheritence [about]
- where:
    - [grok] => Grokking a topic
    - [teach] => ability to communicate topic to colleagues in a way they can teach it or know about it
    - [about] => knows about a topic at a high level enough to know it exists and do further research as needed

## Acceptance
- criteria used to determine completion of this module
- answers these questions:
    - what have the students learned?
    - what can a student do to demonstrate knowledge or mastery?
    - how do we know that a student has obtained proper training?
