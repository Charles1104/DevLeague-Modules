# Sorting

## Suggested order of delivery
1. Intro to Sorting Algorithms (whiteboard)
1. Intro Bubble Sort (whiteboard)
1. Have the students implement bubblesort on their own
1. Check in, verify they understand by having them whiteboard the algorithm to others in a small group.
1. Intro Quick Sort (whiteboard)
1. [Quick Sort](https://github.com/devleague/slides-quicksort)
1. Have the students implement Quick Sort on their own
1. Check in, verify they understand by having them whiteboard the algorithm to others in a small group.
their solution in small groups
1. verify (acceptance)
