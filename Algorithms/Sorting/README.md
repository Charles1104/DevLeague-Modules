# Sorting Algorithms

## Pre-Requisites
This material should be issued after the students have a strong grasp of how the front end works. This is one of the last units we cover, before switching to the server side.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 2 full days to introduce and up to 3 days to cover all the assignments

## Topics & Expected Outcomes
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Quick sort [grok]
  - Bubble sort [grok]
  - Merge sort [teach]
  - Insertion sort [teach]
  - Selection sort [teach]
- Big O [teach]

## Acceptance
- Students should have implemented the following:
  - Quick sort
  - Bubble sort
  - Merge sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
- Students should be able to whiteboard each sorting algorithm for the class by the end of this module.
- Students should be able to explain the aver, best, and worst case big O complexity for each algorithm

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Intro to Sorting Algorithms (whiteboard)
1. Intro Bubble Sort (whiteboard)
  1. Sort a sample data set on the whiteboard for the class - show how it works before digging into the algorithm
1. Have the students implement bubblesort on their own
1. Check in, verify they understand Bubble Sort by having them whiteboard the algorithm to others in a small group.
