# Sorting

## Suggested order of delivery
1. Intro to Sorting Algorithms (whiteboard)
1. Intro Bubble Sort (whiteboard)
1. Have the students implement bubblesort on their own
1. Check in, verify they understand Bubble Sort by having them whiteboard the algorithm to others in a small group.
1. Intro Quick Sort (whiteboard)
1. [Quick Sort](https://github.com/devleague/slides-quicksort)
1. Have the students implement Quick Sort on their own
1. Check in, verify they understand by having them whiteboard Quick Sort to others in a small group.
their solution in small groups
1. [Big O](https://github.com/devleague/slides-big-o)
1. [Sorting Algorithms Assignment](https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/blob/master/Algorithms/Sorting/SORTING.md)
1. Check in, verify they understand various algorithms by having them whiteboard Quick Sort to others in a small group.


## Topics
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Quick sort [grok]
  - Bubble sort [grok]
  - Merge sort [teach]
  - Insertion sort [teach]
  - Selection sort [teach]
- Big O [teach]

## Acceptance
- Students should have implemented the following:
  - Quick sort
  - Bubble sort
  - Merge sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
- Students should be able to whiteboard each sorting algorithm for the class by the end of this module.
- Students should be able to explain the aver, best, and worst case big O complexity for each algorithm
