# Graphs and Trees

## Suggested order of delivery
TBD

## Topics
### Binary Trees
* **In-Order:** Traverse left node, current node, then right [usually used for binary search trees]
* **Pre-Order:**Traverse current node, then left node, then right node.
* **Post-Order:**Traverse left node, then right node, then current node.
* **Insert Node:**On a binary search tree, we insert a value v, by comparing it to the root. If v > root, we go right, and else we go left. We do this until we hit an empty spot in the tree.

###Graph Traversal
* **Depth-first Search [DFS]:**DFS involves searching a node and all its children before proceed- ing to its siblings.
* **Breadth-first Search [BFS]:**BFS involves searching a node and its siblings before going on to any children.

## Acceptance
### Binary Trees
1. Implement a tree / find a node / delete a node / other well known algorithm.
2. Implement a modi cation of a known algorithm.
Either way, it is strongly recommended that students understand the important tree algorithms.

###Graph Traversal
- Students implementatied BFS and DFS in JavaScript
- Students can whiteboard BFS and DFS solution on the whiteboard and explain the following:
  - Create Node
  - Delete Node
  - Find Node
