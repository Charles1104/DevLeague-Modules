# Linked Lists

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **revealing module pattern** and definitely before **MVC**. Students should already be familiar with **requiring external modules** and **exporting modules**.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 hour to introduce and 1 to 2 days to implement all the Linked List methods in JavaScript.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

- Linked Lists General [grok]
- Linked Lists Methods [teach]
  - Create Node
  - Delete Node
  - Find Node
- Linked List Concepts [about]
  - Singly linked list
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce Linked Lists (whiteboard a Linked List)
1. Present **Linked List** Slideshow: [Linked Lists Slideshow](https://github.com/devleague/slides-js-linked-lists)
1. Assign **Linked List Generator**: [JS Linked Lists](https://github.com/devleague/js-linked-list)
1. Have the students whiteboard their solution in small groups
1. Check in with students and their understanding of **Linked Lists**, and **Linked List methods** (talk)
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.

## Acceptance
- Students have all tests passing on their linked list implementation
- Students can whiteboard Linked List solution on the whiteboard and explain the following:
  - Create Node
  - Delete Node
  - Find Node
