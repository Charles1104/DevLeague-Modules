# Google Interview Questions

The questions here were asked of previous DevLegaue intructors and students during interviews at **Google**

1. First is the attached PDF, this one covers technical phone screen basics

2. Refresh on your CS fundamentals:

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/ - with particular attention given to the "Searching and Sorting" section

http://bigocheatsheet.com/ - for a recap on BigO of these DS/Algo's

3. For good strategies on how to approach interview questions: hiredintech.com/app -with particular attention to the sections 'Algorithm Design' and 'Systems Design'

4. Make sure and try some practice questions on sites like HackerRank, TopCoder, CodeChef, CareerCup.com, or projecteuler.net - handwrite your solutions!

Quora: https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-prepare-for-my-Google-interview-if-I-have-1-month-left

[3:28 PM]
here is the copy paste from the email

[3:29 PM]
it was recommended to take time to study up on this material

[3:29 PM]
I scheduled it one month later

[3:29 PM]
which was probably a little long

[3:29 PM]
I don't think the phone screen was that bad

[3:30 PM]
Anyways, about the phone interview

[3:31 PM]
It is 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions

[3:31 PM]
1 is "easy", 1 is "hard"

[3:31 PM]
and the coding is done via google docs

[3:31 PM]
they said a lot of people struggle with programming in google docs so they should prep for it in advance

[3:32 PM]
The questions I got:

[3:33 PM]
sorry I wrote them down looking them up

[3:33 PM]
1st one was to make a counter that increments

[3:34 PM]
or rather an increment function

[3:34 PM]
given a number that is in an array

[3:34 PM]
so

[3:34 PM]
[8,0,0,1] => [8,0,0,2]

[3:35 PM]
so given an array it will increment the number that that array represents

[3:36 PM]
They wanted to know any edge cases that might occur

[3:36 PM]
and after I finished writing the question

[3:36 PM]
they asked me what the run time of the algorithm I made was

[3:37 PM]
second question was harder

[3:38 PM]
The question was to make an algorithm that when given a string it would correct any typos made from pressing a nearby key and suggest a list of correct words

[3:38 PM]
so given

[3:39 PM]
"WEARCH"

[3:39 PM]
it would return "SEARCH"

[3:39 PM]
they said I was provided a map of keys and their surrounding keys

[3:39 PM]
s => {a,q,w,e,d,x,z}

[3:40 PM]
and a function that determines if a string is a word

[3:40 PM]
dict(word) => boolean

[3:40 PM]
when I finished that one they asked me about how many possible combinations could be made

[3:41 PM]
I forgot to mention that they matched me with a interviewer who knew javascript and java because I told the recruiter those were my two strongest languages (edited)

[3:41 PM]
so don't lie about that

[3:42 PM]
At the end of the phone interview they asked me about my django experience because I had worked with django when I was in college

[3:43 PM]
I guess they liked that?

[3:43 PM]
I talked a little about why I liked node

[3:43 PM]
and that was it

[3:43 PM]
I took a long time on the first problem

[3:43 PM]
and never actually coded the second

[3:43 PM]
I just talked through it

[3:44 PM]
The whole thing is 45 minutes and I don't know if I could have even coded the second one in that time

[3:45 PM]
Anyways a couple of days later I got a call back from the recruiter who I had been in contact with all along telling me I passed the phone screen

[3:46 PM]
They gave me a little feedback

[3:46 PM]
Said I could be a little quicker in coding

[3:47 PM]
and then they passed me off to another recruiter who would give me details on the on-site interview

[3:47 PM]
and since then I have been in contact with this new recruiter

[3:48 PM]
forgot to mention but when the first recruiter first talked to me they asked me where I would like to work

[3:48 PM]
They have campuses in Mountain View and Seattle

[3:48 PM]
I said seattle

[3:48 PM]
so this new recruiter is from the seattle team

[3:49 PM]
So I talked to him

[3:49 PM]
basically went over some of what I already went over with the first recruiter about my experience

[3:50 PM]
and we disscussed what the on site would be like and scheduled a time i could do it

[3:50 PM]
From what I heard from him

[3:50 PM]
the on site is a whole day

[3:50 PM]
5 interviews each 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions each

[3:50 PM]
with an hour long break after the first two

[3:51 PM]
much like the phone interview except harder and more academic?

[3:51 PM]
and that was my entire experience until now...

[3:52 PM]
sorry for the essay. If you wanna know something in particular let me know

[3:52 PM]
Joe Karlsson Yes! This is good!

[3:52 PM]
Thank you for taking the time to type it up :thumbsup:

[3:53 PM]
It wil help so many future DL students

[3:53 PM]
Taylor Kennedy I should mention that the interviewers grade you during the on site and pass it to a hiring team

[3:54 PM]
who actually make decisions

[3:54 PM]
and then different google teams can pick and contact you about offers after that

[3:54 PM]
so it's not like applying for a particular job they kinda match you I guess?

[3:56 PM]
here's the list of teams in seattle:

[3:56 PM]
Ad Platforms/Services

   Cloud Platform

   Cardboard (Virtual Reality)

   Geo (maps)

   Communications (hangouts)

   Corp Engineering

   Social Ranking

   Security

   Android / Android Auto
