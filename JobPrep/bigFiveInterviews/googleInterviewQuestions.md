# Google Interview Questions

The questions here were asked of previous DevLegaue intructors and students during interviews at **Google**

#### Google Phone Screening
It is 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions

1 problem is "easy", and 1 problem is "hard"

The coding is done via google docs. Alot of people struggle with programming in google docs so you should prep for it in advance.

#### Interview Challenges from Google:

1. ##### Make a counter
  - Make a counter, but the number must be stored in an array. So `[8, 0, 0, 1]` increments to `[8, 0, 0, 2]`.
  - What is the time complexity of this algorithm?

1. ##### Implement a sort of autocorrect when you hit the wrong key
Implement a sort of autocorrect when you hit the wrong key so "WEARCH" would return "SEARCH"
given a map with the key and its surrounding keys:

`S => { a, q, w,e,d, x,z}`

The function should return true if a string is actually a word.
and they asked about the number of possible combinations

### On Site Interview
5 interviews each 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions each with an hour long break after the first two much like the phone interview except harder and more academic.
