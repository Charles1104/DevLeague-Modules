# Google Interview Questions

The questions here were asked of previous DevLegaue intructors and students during interviews at **Google**

#### Demystify the Google Hiring Process
- 1-2 phone interviews
- Up to 5 on-site interviews
- Local Hiring Committee (HC) review
- Regional and Company HC Review
- Offer
  - Take hiring very seriously

#### Google Phone Screening
It is 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions

1 problem is "easy", and 1 problem is "hard"

The coding is done via google docs. Alot of people struggle with programming in google docs so you should prep for it in advance.

#### Interview Challenges from Google:

1. ##### Make a counter
  - Make a counter, but the number must be stored in an array. So `[8, 0, 0, 1]` increments to `[8, 0, 0, 2]`.
  - What is the time complexity of this algorithm?

1. ##### Implement a sort of autocorrect when you hit the wrong key
Implement a sort of autocorrect when you hit the wrong key so "WEARCH" would return "SEARCH"
given a map with the key and its surrounding keys:

`S => { a, q, w,e,d, x,z}`

The function should return true if a string is actually a word.
and they asked about the number of possible combinations

### On Site Interview
5 interviews each 45 minutes long with 2 coding questions each with an hour long break after the first two much like the phone interview except harder and more academic.

Slide Notes
- Sound design
  - How did you come about your solution?
  - How do you solve problems?
  - Think out loud, ask questions, be more vocal
  - Thought process > Right answer
- On-site interviews: Practice on a whiteboard
- Phone/video interviews: Practice in Google doc or Word doc
- You may switch your language of preference the day of the interview
- Why can't Google give you real problems they're facing?
  - They present simple questions during the interview because context takes time to explain
- Give the interviewer the opportunity to interject as you work through a problem
- When working through a technical problem: make it work, make it right, make it fast
- If you can't remember an API method exactly, it's fine, no big deal, ask
Question and Answer Portion
- Does attire matter?
  - Wear what you're comfortable in
  - But yes, before the interview, you can ask the interviewer if you're still not sure
- If you're truly stuck, is it alright to ask for a different question?
  - Nope, try to isolate the portion you don't understand and ask for help on that
- Is it truly alright to ask questions?
  - YES
  - Interviewers are generally engineers, not professional interviewers
  - If you don't understand, you should ask
  - Committee can review interviewers as well; they know how long it takes an interviewee to respond to the same question the interviewer keeps asking, for example
  - Try to ask upfront; don't spend 10 minutes and then say "I don't understand the question."  For example, it's good to ask during the design phase; make sure you and the interviewer both agree on an example that satisfies the design before you begin the implementation.
- How long must I wait before I reapply again?
  - You can reapply whenever
  - You may not need to reapply, Google may contact you again
  - Generally if the reason you didn't get an offer is "you don't have enough experience," it's good to try again after 18 months
- Am I competing against others for the same position?
  - There isn't one job and three applicants; if everybody is the best, then everybody gets the job
  - Your biggest adversary is yourself
- What are typical things about Google interviewees ask about?
  - Mobility within the company (usually no need to go through more interviews), tech stacks, work/life balance
- Why is Google so selective?
  - They look for smart, capable, and trustworthy individuals
  - Because they are so selective, it allows the individual Google employee greater autonomy to do big things at Google
- Lack of diversity - not as many females.  What could be the reason?  What could women do better?
  - It comes down to the applicant pool: there are more males who apply
  - Less female engineering graduates
  - Google is trying what they can but it's a fundamental problem with women in engineering in general
- How are resumes chosen?
  - Active recruiters
  - University efforts
  - Other
- What do you look for in a resume?
  - Interesting projects you've done
  - Are you involved in open source?
  - GPA is not an important factor to Google
  - Are you a CS grad?  If not, what are your projects / work experience?
- How many projects / how much work experience do you look for?
  - You wrote the code, but do you really understand it?  What are the implications?  The tradeoffs?
  - How deeply do you care about your code?
  - Let your curiosity run wild!
- At what point does your GitHub activity come into play?
  - If it's there on your resume
  - Prior to interview, someone may look it over
  - Phone interviewer may review it, but they won't necessarily assess the complexity of it
- What do you look for in bootcamp graduates?
  - Don't worry
  - Be proud of what you've accomplished
  - Proudly display your projects somewhere easily visible and accessible
- His one great advice
  - Overly communicate!
  - Bounce ideas off the interviewer if you have to
