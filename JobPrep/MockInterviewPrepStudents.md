# Mock Interview Preperation for Students

DevLeague believes in the value of an authentic interview experience. As with every skill we teach, it's important for the students to learn the technique and then practice, practice, practice. A mock interview will not only help the students perfect their technique, but it will also allow them to get valuable feedback and coaching on their performance.

#### A typical technical interview has the following components:

1. Initial soft questions about the students experience.
1. Technical inteview question

## Tips to prepare for the mock interview

- **Know yourself and the potential employer** - spend time thinking about your goals, talents, skills, abilities, and experiences (what positive stories can you tell).
- **Research before you go** - find literature or information online about the organization and its products so you are well informed.
- **Create Your Elevator Speech** - prepare a 2-5 minute sales pitch about yourself and rehearse with a friend or family.
- **Make a list of 5 questions to ask the interviewer about the organization and/or the position.**

## Technical Interview

In order to gauge your technical skills - a potential employeer may have you whiteboard a technical challenege that your have never solved before. Interviews are supposed to be difficult. If you don’t get every – or any – answer immediately, that’s ok!  Take note of the following while they are solving the problem:

  - A technical interview question can be solved utilizing a five step approach:
    1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity
    1. Design an Algorithm
    1. Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you’re writing pseudo-code! Otherwise, he/she may think that you’re never planning to write “real” code, and many interviewers will hold that against you
    1. Write your code, not too slow and not too fast
    1. Test your code and carefully  x any mistakes
  - **Talk it Out** Did you bring your interviewer along with your problem solving process? This can be as simple as outlining what you’re about to do when you’re doing it (“So, I’ll need a for-loop to iterate through all the items in this list”) or posing problems to yourself as you go (“This means I’ll need a better way to access the information; hmm, I’ll get back to that later”).
  - **Whiteboard your solution** The point is to use your time up front to structure your approach, not to try to write all the code in your head before you touch marker to whiteboard.
  - **Bring your People Skills, Too** Just because you’re going for an engineering job doesn’t mean you can slack on being personable and responsible.
  - **Know yourself and the potential employer** - spend time thinking about your goals, talents, skills, abilities, and experiences (what positive stories can you tell).
  - **Research before you go** - find literature or information online about the organization and its products so you are well informed.
  - **Create Your Elevator Speech** - prepare a 2-5 minute sales pitch about yourself and rehearse with a friend or family.
  - **Make a list of 5 questions to ask the interviewer about the organization and/or the position.**
  - **Practice Whiteboarding** - Solve problems without the aid of your text editor or the internet. Be sure to practice talking through your solution out loud. You will look crazy talking to yourself, this is okay.
  - **Review Algorithms** - Sorting algorithms, Linked Lists, Red Black trees, Search algorithms, etc.

    - Pay particular attention to the sections 'Algorithm Design' and 'Systems Design'
  - Do not regurgitate DevLeague marketing materials during an interview. Most interviewers do not care about the program you went through, they care about what you can immediately bring to their team/company.
  - Focus on your ability to learn new technical concepts quickly - Companies want Junior Develoeprs that can get up to speed as quickly as possible with as little as possible assistance.

  - **Review interviews questions encountered by previous DevLeague students** [Check out write ups previous DevLeague students have done after interviewing at big companies](https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/tree/master/JobPrep/bigFiveInterviews)
  - **Review Concepts** - Review vocab, design patterns, frameworks, libraries
  - **Practice coding problems** - Practice solving code interview style questions from:
  - [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - [Coder Byte](https://coderbyte.com/)
  - [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/)
  - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
  - [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
  - [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com/)
  - [Career Cup](https://careercup.com/)
    - Try setting time limits for yourself
    - Try solving them on a whiteboard or by hand
  - **Look sharp** :sparkles:
