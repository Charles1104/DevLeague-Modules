# Mock Interview Preperation for Students

DevLeague believes in the value of an authentic interview experience. As with every skill we teach, it's important for the students to learn the technique and then practice, practice, practice. A mock interview will not only help the students perfect their technique, but it will also allow them to get valuable feedback and coaching on their performance.

Tl;Dr: Know your stuff. Learn the language well and Practice! Brush up on data Structures/Algorithms.

#### A typical technical interview has the following components:

- Short introduction/TMAY (TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF) -> Technical Communication
- "The Meat" or a technical assessment
- Close with your questions

#### Engineering Skills Assessment
- Write good code
- Algorithms and data structures ( SUPER IMPORTANT )
- Analytical skills ( Came about in reasonable matter... had approach to solution)
- Sound design ( ... )
- Technical Communication ( How well you can convey technical ideas ) ... (Can be a deal breaker) ...

## Tips to prepare for the mock interview

- **Know yourself and the potential employer** - spend time thinking about your goals, talents, skills, abilities, and experiences (what positive stories can you tell).
- **Research before you go** - find literature or information online about the organization and its products so you are well informed.
- **Create Your Elevator Speech** - prepare a 2-5 minute sales pitch about yourself and rehearse with a friend or family.
- **Make a list of 5 questions to ask the interviewer about the organization and/or the position.**
- **Look sharp** :sparkles:


## How to prepare for your interview (PRACTICE WITH SOMEONE -- IDEAL)
- Practice with someone
- Review algorithms and data structures
- Practice writing code, especially if youre out of practice; focus on your strongest language
  - Practice on a whiteboard or paper ( IDEALLY PRACTICE ON WHITEBOARD!!!! ) Writing on whiteboard can be difficult, practice is important
  - Don't use pseudo code!! -- we (GOOGLE) want actual code
  -Interviewer will ask which language you prefer (recruiter will ask you in advance)

## During the actual technical interview
In order to gauge your technical skills - a potential employeer may have you whiteboard a technical challenege that your have never solved before. Interviews are supposed to be difficult. If you don’t get every – or any – answer immediately, that’s ok!  Take note of the following while they are solving the problem:

- Interviewers are interested in how you approach problem-solving. Think out loud. Ask questions. (THEY MIGHT ASK A QUESTION WITHOUT AN ANSWER) (Tests whether you are methodical about problem solving and digging)  (Be overly vocal about what you don't know ... NOT ADMITTING DEFEAT) (they want this) (Right answer is uneccessary)
- Their questions will be in-depth. We want to see how you think about complicated problems.
- The right answer would be nice but it is not necessary -- your thought process is more important.
- Sample Interview Question
  - "Write a program that breaks up a string of words with no spaces into a string with the appropriate spaces."
  - Abstract questions rely on raw fundamentals. Contextual setup takes time, which an interview does not have.

- No pass for "being rusty". You are expected to prepare for your interview.
- Dress comfortably. Suits are disadvantage if youre uncomfortable in them.
- Practice for onsite technical interviews: use a whiteboard
- Practice for phone-/video: practice in a Google Doc.
- Technical Interviews are not adversarial
  - I recommend a collaborative demeanor
- **Manage your time**
  - Design is good up front, but, leave time for implementation
  - If youre putting somethign aside (boundary conditions, optimization, function definition, etc). Say so!
- Don't try to intepret the interviewers mood/body language, etc
- How you come to an answer is just as important as the answer
- The question might not have an answer! (Might not have an answer, but it might have milestones)
- A technical interview question can be solved utilizing a five step approach:
  1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity
  1. Design an Algorithm
  1. Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you’re writing pseudo-code! Otherwise, he/she may think that you’re never planning to write “real” code, and many interviewers will hold that against you
  1. Write your code, not too slow and not too fast
  1. Test your code and carefully  x any mistakes
- **Clarify the problem**
  - Consider an example that's rich enough but no tedious: (CLARIFICATION IS IMPORTANT, USE EXAMPLES, ASK WHAT THEY MEAN)
  - State and clarify key assumptions: expectyed result, any memory or performance requirements, etc.
  - Clarify the function signature
  - Start with the first solution that comes to mind
  - Feel free to say that your first solution will be refined later
    - This will usually be a brute force solution
- **Talk it Out** Did you bring your interviewer along with your problem solving process? This can be as simple as outlining what you’re about to do when you’re doing it (“So, I’ll need a for-loop to iterate through all the items in this list”) or posing problems to yourself as you go (“This means I’ll need a better way to access the information; hmm, I’ll get back to that later”).
- **Whiteboard your solution** The point is to use your time up front to structure your approach, not to try to write all the code in your head before you touch marker to whiteboard.
  - Run through at least one or two examples to check for correctness
  - Check again for edge cases
  - Try to use reasonable variable names or clean up the code after the first pass
  - Ask if the interviewer has any questions before refinement (GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITY TO INTERJECT)...(REASONABLE VARIABLE NAMES -- MAKE SURE IT MAKES SENSE) ... (BAD VARIABLE NAMES WILL BE CALLED OUT) ... (INCONSISTENT VARIABLE NAMING SCHEMES LIKE 'x' FOR ONE PART AND 'blahblahblahblah' FOR ANOTHER)
  - If you can't remember the name of a method, or how % behaves with negative umbers, asK!
  Testing
  - Say what cases would you test (Why did you choose these tests. Part of technical communication!!!!!!!!!)
  - Try to reserve time to work small case (iron out  boundary conditions)
- **Optimize your solution**
  -Talk through naive solution(s), see if you can come up with a reasonable efficient one
  -Time/space tradeoffs
  -Assumptions: what if the input is big? small?
- **What if I get stuck, nervous, don't know, etc...**
  -Break down the problem
  --Identify what you know and don't know
  --Time/space tradeoffs
  --Assumptions: what if the input is big? Small?
  Talk it out ( part of technical communication ... part of real life with teammates ... part of collaboration)
  -Review your current assumptions with the interviewer
  -Showing them where you are stuc helps both of you
  -Communication is key - don't shut down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! don't clam up! don't be silent! admit you don't know if you don't and give approaches!
- **Bring your People Skills, Too** Just because you’re going for an engineering job doesn’t mean you can slack on being personable and responsible.
- **Practice Whiteboarding** - Solve problems without the aid of your text editor or the internet. Be sure to practice talking through your solution out loud. You will look crazy talking to yourself, this is okay.
- **Review Algorithms** - Sorting algorithms, Linked Lists, Red Black trees, Search algorithms, etc.

  - Pay particular attention to the sections 'Algorithm Design' and 'Systems Design'
- Do not regurgitate DevLeague marketing materials during an interview. Most interviewers do not care about the program you went through, they care about what you can immediately bring to their team/company.
- Focus on your ability to learn new technical concepts quickly - Companies want Junior Develoeprs that can get up to speed as quickly as possible with as little as possible assistance.
- **Review interviews questions encountered by previous DevLeague students** [Check out write ups previous DevLeague students have done after interviewing at big companies](https://github.com/devleague/DevLeague-Modules/tree/master/JobPrep/bigFiveInterviews)
- **Review Concepts** - Review vocab, design patterns, frameworks, libraries
- **Practice coding problems** - Practice solving code interview style questions from:
