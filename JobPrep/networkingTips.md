# The Simple Magic of Professional Networking
> Presenter: Representative Lauren Cheape Matsumoto

## Making Connections:
  - do it before you need it
  - build relationships first
  - say the person's name back to them a few times (helps you remember but also starts to build a positive connection)
  - never dismiss someone as unimportant
  - know the right amount of time to spend talking to someone
  - ask questions and listen, listen, and listen

## Tips for remembering name
  - meet and repeat
    - Have them spell it out (names are unique and spelled differently it also helps you to remember)
  - make connections to help you retain their name

  - connections to people you already know, famous people, etc.
    > "Oh, I have a cousin who spells their name that way!"

    > "A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H? -You're the first person I've met who's spelled it that way"
  - speak up - forgot the name? ask!
  - lead the way
    - present your trick to remembering your name. perhaps theyll share their trick.
    - Laruen's trick (her maiden name is `Cheap`)

      > "Hi, I'm Lauren Cheape, as in 'expensive'."

  - choose to care - people with respond better when you are invested

## Knowing your audience
  - before going to an event make sure you know what it entails
  - know who is going to be in attendance.
    - try to obtain a conference list (not always available but very handy if it is)
  - be prepared
    - reseach the companies or people
    - have potential questions ready
  - from children to CEOs be comfortable at their level
    - its the little things that make a difference (if someone can't stand, then kneel. Talking to a child, then kneel. do you best to get to eye-level)

## Dress the part
  - know the event (formal, casual, outdoor athletic event, etc.)
  - better to overdress than under dress.

  - know the theme: colors, shapes, etc. and try to incorporate them into your outfit.
  - stand out but dont be distracting (fine line)
  - be professional

## How to work a room
  - go with a purpose
    - remind yourself why you are there
    - dont waste time
  - name tags
    - wear them on your right (their left)
  - use inside contacts (crutch contacts)
    - have someone introduce you
  - be a lone ranger
    - beware of the trap (of staying with the same group)
    - branch out (have you hit your goal, no? keep moving)
  - get the lay of the land
    - look for potentially positive interactions
  - eat/drink something before event
  - body language
    - be aware of your own body language
    - dont close off
  - break the ice
    - dont feel like you have to say anything profound
    - ask open ended questions
  - move around the room
    - invest about 3-5 mins, max 7 mins

## Small talk (lead with it but dont rely on it)
  - arrive early
  - recognize when the conversation has changed (conversation has changed, dont force the old topic into convo instead...)
  - missed stories can have a purpose (future connection; use the missed topic previously as your spark for this new opportunity)
  - dont miss out on deeper opportunities
  - dont talk too much (keeps you from listening)

## Business cards
  - always have your business cards with you, even at the gym
  - dont start with the card
  - it doesnt matter if you give them your card, you need theirs!
  - never write on someone's card (do it at home).

## Follow through
  - if you say you will get in touch, do it
    - timely matter
  - it takes 1 minutes to send off an email or make a call.
  - dont lose the cards you collect
    - put into an online database
    - file in a binder
  - CamCard (app)
  - Get over your fear of rejection

## Last tips
  - be visible
  - get there early, leave late
  - build trust
  - diversify (dont go to the same types of events)
    - Networking happens everywhere, birthday parties, at the gym, everywhere.
      - Going to an insurance convention and selling insurance? You're not going to stand out.
  - give back as much as you can ("people dont care what you know until they know what you care about")
  - never think you are above something
  - if you lose touch, dont hestitate to rekindle the relationship
  - make your best effort to remember people
  - put a picture of yourself on your own business card
