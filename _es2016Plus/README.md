#### ES6 Portfolio Piece Refactor
- Repository: Any portfolio project [Express Galley, Kanban, etc...]
- Average Time Alotted: 3 sessions
- Individual or Group: Individual Exercise
- Completed Example: N/A
- Concepts Practiced: *ES6 Constructors*, *ES6 Instance Properties*, *Scope Variables*, *ES6 Super Call*, *Maps*, *Sets* and *Exporting and Importing Modules*
