This material should come after the students feel very comfortable with ES5 JavaScript syntax. This will suppliment their knowledge of ES6 and build on top of a firm understanding of JavaScript. They should be able to appreciate the pain points that ES6 is attempting to solve.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce and up to a day's worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

1. Introduce ES6 [talk]
  1. Talk about the history of JS and why we use
1. Present **ES6 Plus** Slideshow: [ES6 Plus Slides](http://slides.com/joecarlson/es6)
1. Assign **ES6 Practice Problems**: [ES6 Practice](https://github.com/devleague/es6-Practice)
1. Check in with students
1. Assign **ES6 Portfolio Piece Refactor**
1. Verify that students have met the minimum required understanding before moving on.

- Time Needed to Present: < 45 minutes
- Type: **Slideshow**

# Exercises & Projects
The following exercises and projects state an average time alotted. A session is about 3 hours. There are 3 sessions in a day: (1) After the morning challenge up to lunch, (2) after lunch up to dinner, (3) after dinner until the end of class.

#### ES6 Practice Problems
- Repository: [ES6 Practice](https://github.com/devleague/es6-Practice)
- Average Time Alotted: 1 sessions
- Individual or Group: Individual Exercise
- Completed Example: N/A
- Concepts Practiced: *ES6 Constructors*, *ES6 Instance Properties*, *Scope Variables*, *ES6 Super Call*, *Maps*, *Sets* and *Exporting and Importing Modules*

#### ES6 Portfolio Piece Refactor
- Repository: Any portfolio project [Express Galley, Kanban, etc...]
- Average Time Alotted: 3 sessions
- Individual or Group: Individual Exercise
- Completed Example: N/A
- Concepts Practiced: *ES6 Constructors*, *ES6 Instance Properties*, *Scope Variables*, *ES6 Super Call*, *Maps*, *Sets* and *Exporting and Importing Modules*
- Notes: Add Airbnb ESlint to an old project and refactor it to be ES6 complient - great practice using ES6 for a real project - plus it has the posibility of making the code look super dope.
- To install `eslint` for your project and SublimeText:

  1. `npm i -D eslint`
  1. `./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`

  1. Select the following options
    1. `? How would you like to configure ESLint? Use a popular style guide`
    1. `? Which style guide do you want to follow? AirBnB`
    1. `? What format do you want your config file to be in? JavaScript`

  1. install the following plugins on sublime:
    - `eslint`
    - `sublimeLinter-contrib-eslint`

  1. add this to your `.package.json` under the scripts section:
    "eslint": "eslint ."

  1. run this in the command line
    ...
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
      "eslint": "eslint ."
    },
    ...

  1. BOOM - Yah got a badass linter

  **Note** - You might need to restart Sublime Text to get your linter working
