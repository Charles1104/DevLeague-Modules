# Debriefing Classroom Tips

##### Debrief by questions.
Helps us stay focused on the question and helps see if there are any patterns across cohorts.

##### Debrief in small groups then medium groups.
We usually debrief in small groups (groups of 4 with whom we observed), and then in combined groups (groups of 8 with 2 groups who saw some of the same classrooms at different times). Smaller networks may have a small-group followed by a whole-group structure.

##### Share talk time.
We often use a guideline like “everyone speaks once before anyone speaks twice” or “three before me” to help balance air time and hear from everyone.
