# Events

## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **Server-Side Intro to Node.js** and definitely before **Streams**. Students should already be somewhat familiar with **Node.js**.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 0.5 day(s) to introduce and up to 2 days worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.

---

#### Events 
- Students should **fully grok** events in Node.js.
- Students should **fully grok** the event loop and event driven programming in Node.js.
- Students should **fully grok** Node.js' single thread vs. multi-thread.
- Students should **fully grok** the blocking and non-blocking IO model.

#### Adding Event Listeners/Handlers
- Students should **grok** adding event listeners.
- Students should **grok** extending a class from the Events class.
- Students should **explain** what context the event is being emitted from and it's parent Event class.

#### Emitting Events
- Students should **fully grok** emitting events.

#### Removing Events
- Students should **grok** removing events from a class.
- Students should **explain** when to remove an event after it's been triggered.

# Suggested Format of Delivery
The following content is meant to a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students. 

1. Present **Events and Emitters** Slidedeck: [http://slides.com/theremix/events-and-emitters#/](http://slides.com/theremix/events-and-emitters#/)
1. Live coding along with events and emitters slide deck.
1. Check in with students on understanding of Node.js Events.

# Exercises and Projects
The following exercises and projects state an average time alotted. A session is about 3 hours. There are 3 sessions in a day: (1) After the morning challenge up to lunch, (2) after lunch up to dinner, (3) after dinner until the end of class.

[No Exercises at this time]
