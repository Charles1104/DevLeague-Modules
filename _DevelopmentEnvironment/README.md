#### Package Management :package:

**Homebrew** [Link][brew_url] *see webpage for installation instructions*

```
Homebrew allows a user to install/update/uninstall programs (packages/binaries) via the command-line. These packages come prepackaged with default installation instructions so the installation process is much quicker than installing the same software manually.

It Just Works™
```

**Homebrew Cask** [Link][cask_url]

```
Cask focuses on everyday Applications like Google Chrome, Spotify, etc.
```

#### Window Management :metal:

**Spectacle** [Link][spectacle_url] *Easily organize windows without using a mouse*

```
Amazing tool (AND FREE)! Strive to be the best keyboard warrior you can be.
```
