## Pre-Requisites
This material should come after **Intro to Node and Sockets** and definitely before **Express**. Students should already be familiar with basic **Client and Server Communication**.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 2 full day to introduce and up to a week's worth of exercises and reinforcement.

## Topics & Expected Outcomes

#### Levels of Understanding
Students will have *one of three* levels of understanding about each topic upon completion of this module.
- **grok**: fully understand the topic in order to replicate code, communicate, and explain concepts without referring to any notes.
- **explain**: understand enough about the topic to describe concepts without referring to notes.
- **know about**: understand enough to look up further documentation when asked about the subject.
